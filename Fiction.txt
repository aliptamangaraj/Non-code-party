You never reply me
You never wait for me
You never look back at me
You never follow me back
You never walk with me 
You never talk with me 
You never smile at me 
You never say Hi to me 
You never say Bye to me
You haven’t even saved my number
But today I am pouring my heart out
I admit that you are something
More than what you think 
Our story is just my fiction 
A conflict between my heart and mind 
My mind knows the answer but
My heart isn’t accepting that
